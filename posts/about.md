# About

Data Science @ SC was started in January 2019 with a mission to help UC Santa Cruz students learn practical data science, analytics and machine learning skills.

We welcome students from all majors, though youâ€™ll have an easier time if you already have quantitative and/or programming background!

Some of the things we do
- Machine learning competitions
- Tutorial series on statistical learning theory and practical programming
- Career/resume workshops
- Guest speakers
- Socials
