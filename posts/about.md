# About

Data Science @ UCSC was started in January 2019 with a mission to help 
UC Santa Cruz students learn practical data science, analytics and machine 
learning skills.

We welcome students from all majors, though youâ€™ll have an easier time 
if you already have quantitative and/or programming background!

## Activities

Some of the events we organize:
- Machine learning competitions
- Programming workshops
- Guest lectures
- Socials
- Reading groups

## Meetings

Currently we don't meet in person due to COVID-19.

Additional reading groups and specific projects hold extra meetings in the week.

## Joining

We communicate through our Slack workspace [https://datascienceslugs.slack.com](https://datascienceslugs.slack.com). For an invite link, email us at ucscdatascience@gmail.com, or message us on Instagram [@datascienceucsc](https://www.instagram.com/datascienceucsc/).
