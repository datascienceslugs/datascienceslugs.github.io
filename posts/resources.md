## Tutorials

Find tutorials from past quarters at [github.com/datascienceucsc/workshops](https://github.com/datascienceucsc/workshops)

## Software

### Slack 

We primarly communicate through Slack at [datascienceucsc.slack.com](datascienceucsc.slack.com).

### Git

We collaborate though Github at [datascienceucsc](https://github.com/datascienceucsc).
This hosts most of our past work, including competitions and workshops.

To get access to our Github organization, message an officer on Slack or on Instagram 
[@datascienceuscs](https://www.instagram.com/datascienceucsc/) with your Github username and
email.

In addition, we recommend installing [git](https://git-scm.com/) locally.

### Development Environments

Workings on projects will require access to a development environment for Python
or R. 

#### R

*Coming soon*

#### Python

We recommend one of the following three options to set up a development environment 
for Python and Jupyter Lab. 
 
##### 1. Google Colab 

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) serves Jupyter notebooks in the browser 
without a local installation.

This is a great way to get started if you are not comfortable with the command 
line or Python package management, but we recommend that you enventually learn
how to set up a local environment. 

##### 2. Conda

[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is package and environment management,
which we recommend for managing and creating local Python installations.

To help you get started, we provide 
[pre-defined environments](https://github.com/datascienceucsc/environments).

##### 3. Docker (advanced)

*Coming soon*
